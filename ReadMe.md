                    WELCOME TO FLATIRON PHARMACY CRM

        This is my first project modeled after a pharmaceutical 
        crm(Customer Relationship Managment). I plan on implementing more 
        features as time passes to develop a well rounded model.


                        Starting Up The Servers:

To begin clone down the SSH code into your terminal. After cloning cd into the folder
then run 'code.' to bring up the project in VSCode.

Once VSCode is up open two terminals:

-In terminal one run pipenv shell.
 Once inside the shell enviroment cd into server and run 'python app.py'.
 This will fire up the backend server. 

-In the second terminal no shell is need, simply cd into the clinet directory.
 Once in project/client simply run npm start to fire up the front-end server. 
 If done correctly a new tab should open in your preferred browser. 

                        
                        
                        HOW TO NAVIGATE THE APP

On startup you will be directed to the Login page.

-If you already have login credentials simply input them and be directed to your dashboard.

-If no login credentials have been created click the link to be directed to SignUp. 
 After signing up successfully you will be redirected to the Login page to continue.

If you are viewing this application as a client simply click on the Client link to be 
redirected to your list of orders. Simply click on the dropdown arrows to sort orders by preference. Also filter orders by choice to view specific orders. 


                        DASHBOARD

Once at your dashboard you will see links on the left to:
-APIs
-Clients
-Orders
------
-Add API
-Add Client
-Add Order

To view or delete available APIs navigate to the API page.
To view, edit, or delete client data navigate to the Client page. 
To view or delete orders navigate to the Orders page. 

If you wish to add new APIs, Clients or Orders simply navigate to the proper page 
and input the data required. After submission navigate to the corresponding page to view your new API, Client, or Order. 

There is a basic calendar available on the dashboard to keep up with current date. More features such as adding, editing, and deleteing events with notes are in the works. 

Also in the works are:
-An official cart to properly add new orders with that will perform calculations for total based upon purchase. 
-A map to display location of clients.
-Graphs and charts to display projected sales based off of current and previous orders. 
-Even more to come!
